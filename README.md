## Design Choices and Libraries

* **Responsive Layout:** The choice of CSS Grid or Flexbox depends on the complexity of the layout and developer preference. Grid offers more precise control over row and column placement, while Flexbox is often simpler for one-dimensional layouts.
* **Semantic HTML:** Semantic HTML elements enhance accessibility and code readability. Descriptive tags like `header`, `main`, `section`, and `article` convey the meaning of the content to users and assistive technologies.
* **Figma Design Reference:** The Figma design serves as the visual blueprint, guiding the implementation of UI elements, colors, typography, and overall layout.
